Use some sort of software to view the raw HTML code. This sort of tool is built in to many popular browsers. For instance, I used Google Chrome.

The password is located in a comment, in the `<div id="content">` tag in the main `<body>` tag.

```HTML
    <body>
        <h1>natas0</h1>
        <div id="content">
            "
            You can find th epassword for the next level on this page.
            "

            <!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->

    ...
```
